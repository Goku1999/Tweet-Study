In this project, user is prompted to enter any keyword he/she would like to survey about. The program will extract atmost 100 tweets per call(This number can be increased as per our will) and create a pie chart to tell us what percentage of tweet is showing which trait, namely,fear,sadness,anger,surprise and joy.
The main method is in GUI.java.
Two APIs are used namely tweet4j(api provided by twitter so that we can extract tweets and their details) and indico api(which contains a trained set of data to classify among the emotions using "Machine Learning" , "Natural Language Processing".
To run the project download these APIs then run GUI.java.
